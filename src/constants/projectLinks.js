      "Built a dynamic Instagram clone using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with WebRTC for video and audio calling and Socket.IO for real-time chatting. The application features secure user authentication (Google and email/password), scalable media storage via Cloudinary, and a responsive design. Users can create, edit, and delete posts, comment, like, follow/unfollow others, and personalize profiles. Advanced features include video/audio calls, real-time messaging, and customizable account settings.This project highlights proficiency in full-stack web development, integrating WebRTC and Socket.IO for real-time communication, ensuring a seamless user experience, and demonstrating the ability to create scalable, feature-rich social media platforms.",
