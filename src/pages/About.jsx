          I am a passionate third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology
          in Computer Science and Engineering. My journey into web development began in
          mid-2023, and since then, I've been focused on honing my skills while
          exploring the vast potential of this field.
          <br /> Specializing in backend development, Iâ€™m now eager to expand my
          expertise by transitioning into <i>DevOps</i>. This shift feels like a
          natural evolution in my career, presenting an exciting opportunity to
          deepen my knowledge of building, deploying, and automating dynamic,
          scalable applications with greater efficiency.
